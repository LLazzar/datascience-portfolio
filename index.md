> In this project I tried to replicate the work done in [this paper](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lorenzolazzari98/commit-classification/c15d9775b7d5c70bebbe9179780adbebece193de/reference/paper.pdf). Starting with a 5-class labeled dataset of commit messages and using classical NLP techniques (data cleaning and feature extraction), several baseline classification models were fitted and evaluated. One among the different model has been chosen and fine-tuned using RepeatedKFold validation. Yhe final model ( a logistic regression eone) is finally evaluated on the test set.
